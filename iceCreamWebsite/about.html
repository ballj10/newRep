    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <div id = about1>
      <p class="aboutText">When Arnold Nelson arrived in Tacoma, Washington as a child, he was determined to set out on his own and create his own business, just as his grandfather had done fifty years ago. After working for several years in his youth at a local drugstore, Arnold decided to create his own ice cream shop serving fun and new creations that could bring joy to the local people. His first store location opened in 1945, and has grown over the years to six different locations in the Seattle area.</p>
      <p class="aboutText">Arnold's first employees were his younger brother and sister, and from the first day we opened, we've always seen our employees as family. That's why we're proud to provide great benefits for our employees, including paid time off to volunteer in our communities. We also donate 5% of our profits to supporting veterans in the Seattle area. Our community is of vital importance to us and we're proud to do our part to support it.</p>
