  <h1>Cowgirl Cosmetics</h1>

  <main>
    Founded in 1986, Cowgirl Cosmetics started as the passion project of two young college students and
    has blossomed into an opportunity for dozens of young Cowgirls to express their individuality and increase
    their confidence using our products.
    We proudly are 100% cruelty and vegan, and all of our products are manufactured in the United States.
    We want people who use our products to feel good about themselves, inside and out, which is why 10% of
    our proceeds are donated to women's and other domestic abuse shelters around the country to ensure that
    those in need have what they need to make themselves feel confident and proud.
